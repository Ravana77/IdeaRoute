src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/account/

```

## Usage

### Navigation
- Access via Dashboard â†’ Account Settings button
- Direct URL: `/account`
- Requires authentication (redirects to `/auth` if not logged in)

### Profile Updates
1. User modifies first name, last name, or email
2. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback
3. Save button becomes active when changes are detected
4. Email changes require password confirmation for security
5. Success notification confirms updates

### Account Deletion
1. Three-step confirmation process:
   - Initial warning dialog
   - Password confirmation
   - Type "DELETE" to confirm
2. Deletes both Firebase Auth user and Firestore document
3. Redirects to home page after completion

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Integration
- Uses centralized `updateUserProfile` and `deleteUserAccount` methods
- Integrates with existing Firebase Auth and Firestore setup
- Maintains consistency with app's authentication patterns

### Error Handling
- Firebase Auth error codes mapped to user-friendly messages
- Network error handling with retry suggestions
- Form validation with field-specific error display

### Responsive Design
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile devices
- Optimized typography scaling

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for modal dialogs
- High contrast color ratios

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All sensitive operations require password re-authentication
- Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- Secure token handling for auth operations

### Privacy
- Account deletion removes all user data
- No sensitive information stored in localStorage
- Secure password handling (never stored in state)

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in Firebase Auth rate limiting
- Client-side debouncing for rapid inputs
- Cool-down periods for sensitive operations
